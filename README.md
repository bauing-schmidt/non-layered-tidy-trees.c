# non-layered-tidy-trees.c

This repository contains a translation in C of the algorithm described in the publication

>van der Ploeg, A. (2014), Drawing non-layered tidy trees in linear time, Softw. Pract. Exper., 44, pages 1467â€“ 1484, doi: [10.1002/spe.2213](https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2213)

and implemented in the companion https://github.com/cwi-swat/non-layered-tidy-trees.

We have enhanced it providing both *horizontal layouting*, *centered `x`s and `y`s* and *callbacks*.
